Ever since high school, software development has fascinated me. The ability to command a computer with funny little symbols, limited only by my imagination and ingenuity, has been a constant source of fascination.

This passion guided me through my education at **Punjab Engineering College(PEC), Chandigarh**. Entering a reputed institution like PEC provided an excellent platform for refining technical skills and offered abundant opportunities, deepening my love for technology.

I've delved into C++, mastered data structures and algorithms, explored Java and Python, and pursued Machine Learning and Deep Learning rooted in childhood passion. Guided by mentors, I contributed to a conference paper on Blockchain technology, specifically Atomic Cross-Chain Asset Exchange for Ethereum Public Chains. I've also authored a research paper on Deep Learning, emphasizing the ongoing journey of continuous learning.

My academic journey includes a **Silver medal** for exceptional performance with an overall **CGPA of 9.7**, highlighting my commitment to excellence. Notably, my **major project** in CSE received recognition as the **best in its class**, and my dedication to advancing knowledge in the field is evident through **authored research papers** and successful qualification for **ACM ICPC Amritapuri Regionals** in 2020.

My professional journey has been significantly shaped during my nearly two years at **Apple**. This invaluable experience has not only strengthened my foundation in software development but has also allowed me to collaborate with a dynamic and diverse team of developers, fostering a rich and collaborative environment. I interned for 6 months atÂ **Goldman Sachs**, providing a great learning experience in industry projects, deployment processes, testing, and agile software development techniques.

I find joy in Competitive Programming, where I've learned patience and honed my logical thinking and problem-solving skills significantly. A notable accomplishment was securing a **Global Rank of 14** out of 4000+ participants in a monthly 3-hour coding contest on CodeChef. Outside the tech world, I humbly enjoy playing cricket and badminton.

Having served as **Secretary** and Active Executive Body Member at the **PEC ACM Student Chapter** and as **President** at the **CodeChef PEC Chapter**, I've gained an appreciation for collaborative teamwork in organizational and societal development.

There's certainly more to learn, more problems to solve, and more to build. That's all from me. Thank you!
